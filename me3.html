		<p class="caption">Being the only child of the family was fun, but also lonely. Back then, I really want a brother and a sister. Though its a bit hard for me to adjust, but overall my parents unconditional love taught me to appreciate things what you receive. I am happy being the only child and the only son of the family. I will forever cherish those moments with them.</p>
