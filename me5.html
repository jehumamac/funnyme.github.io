Eventhough as a child, I was certain of it as we know there are a lot of possibilities I may face including struggles and challenges in life. I will keep striving for a better future. To make things happen, to alter the course of the future and if destiny will not let me what I want, then I will carve my own destiny to make things real.</p>
